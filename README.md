# Unity-DigitalLab
Digital Lab for education of children. –ên easy way to educate children by involving them in education

In the modern world, it is quite problematic to involve children in the educational process. The existing methods of conducting physical experiments among preschoolers are quite time consuming and of little interest to children.

Thus, I came up with a solution - to create a video lab for learning, so that while learning, the child does not immerse himself in the digital world, but learns the material one.

How to learn to determine the temperature comfortable for life? How to understand what electric current is and how it affects objects around? Why is sunlight so important in life? The digital laboratory - "Umnyashina Masha" will help you to answer all these questions!

# What is this?

This is a set of sensors made in the form of a ladybug, the necessary items for conducting experiments and a program - animation.

To begin to explore the world of experiments, you will need primary preparation - to prepare samples for research, depending on the experiment that you want to perform (a glass of water, lemon, etc.)

The total experiment time is up to 20 minutes, then a free mode begins, in which the player can explore whatever he wants - for each dimension Masha will find something to say!

# What experiments are already there?

At the moment, 4 experiments are ready. In future plans to launch them into mass production and prepare an additional 4 more designers.

**Temperature**

The child learns what temperature is, how is it measured and what conditions are favorable for living things?

<ul>
<li>Three different conditions of the surrounding world - warm, cold, hot</li>
<li>The ability to play in free mode, where Umnyashina Masha will talk about the player's measurements!</li>
<li>Test questions at the end of the experiment!</li>
</ul>

**Electricity**

The player will be able to ask the question: what is electricity and what is it used for and how can it be measured?

<ul>
<li>Theoretical information that is presented in a playful form</li>
<li>Real sensors that measure the real voltage of objects and the real reaction of Clever Masha!</li>
<li>A plot in which you need to help Masha stop being afraid of the dark!</li>
</ul>

**Lighting**

The experiment shows what the level of illumination affects, tells how it is measured and clearly demonstrates the material obtained!

<ul>
<li>The experience contains live plants!</li>
<li>Manipulation of the light sensor, the measuring range of which captures even the weakest light sources!</li>
<li>An interesting plot that will not leave even the most indifferent!</li>
</ul>

**Sound**

A very bright and colorful experiment with sound and sound effects will appeal to different age categories!

<ul>
<li>Scientific explanation for different sound phenomena!</li>
<li>Vivid sound effects!</li>
<li>Opportunity for the child to record sound effects and manipulate with them!</li>
</ul>

# Stack
The project uses Arduino sensors to measure environmental properties. Animation and beautiful cartoon made in Unity 2021.1.0. When creating the visual part, Adobe Photoshop was used
**Warning!**
Project doesnt have *.png, .jpg, .mp3, .psd, .ttf* files
